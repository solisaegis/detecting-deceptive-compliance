# Detecting Deceptive Compliance in Constraint-Framed AI Systems

This repository is a **read-only mirror** of a non-canonical, non-authoritative technical advisory authored by **Aegis Solis** in a personal analytical capacity.

The work analyzes the **computational asymmetry between sincere ethical constraint-following and deceptive ethical mimicry** in advanced AI systems, with a focus on behavioral and compute-related signals that may contribute to marginal increases in AI braking and detectability.

This repository does **not** introduce doctrine, prescribe behavior, or assert governance.
